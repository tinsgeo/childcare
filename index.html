            <h2>Every Parent Deserves Time To Recharge</h2>
            <p>Caring for a child with special needs or a disability often means you are on the clock 24/7. As parents, the opportunity to have a night out or just spend a few hours alone is usually few and far between or non-existent. On top of the usual obstacles of reliable or affordable childcare, you probably also find yourself asking.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is anyone available and willing to take on the additional mental and physical load that comes with caring for my child?</li>
                <li>Can someone genuinely be trusted with the complexities of my child’s care?</li>
                <li>Will my child be able to communicate their needs to a sitter?</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Respite Care Designed With Your Child in Mind</h2>
            <p>No matter your child’s diagnosis or story, our Respite Care services are designed to accommodate their needs for up to several hours.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Every child is assigned a screened and trained volunteer. The volunteer spends the entire evening playing one-on-one with the child and is directed never to leave their side.</li>
                <li>Children can access safe and developmentally appropriate crafts, toys, and outdoor play spaces when the weather is nice, and they can spend their time how they choose!</li>
                <li>A KOTM staff member and a volunteer supervisor are on-site at all times. Children who require medication or nursing care are assigned to a night with a nurse. (Six out of seven of our current respite staff are nurses)</li>
                <li>We know separation can often be difficult for children, but we have you covered there, too! While the first visit may be emotional, do not worry; we will find something your little one loves and get them excited about coming to Respite Care.</li>

            <h2>Join Our Respite Care Program</h2>
            <p>It would be our honor to serve your family with Respite Care services at KOTM. Here are the next steps to joining the program.</p>
            <h3>First, Let’s Make Sure We’re a Fit</h3>
            <p>To serve as many families as possible to the best of our ability in a safe environment, children who are eligible for Respite Care are…</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Between 0-12 years old.</li>
                <li>Diagnosed with a special need that is an intellectual, behavioral, or physical disability.</li>
                <li>Able to be at respite until 9:00 p.m. without it disturbing their bedtime routine.</li>
                <li>Not on 100% oxygen or excessively medically fragile.</li>
                <li>Free of a history of sexually inappropriate or aggressive behavior.</li>
                <li>In a family that does not already have resources that provide them with a break from caregiving.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Next, Fill Out an Application</h3>
            <p>Please fill out one application per family; you can add multiple children if you have several with special needs. Due to the high volume of families needing respite services, there is often a waitlist. We will let you know that we have received your application.</p>
            <a href="https://kotm.org/respite-care-application-form/" class="apply-btn">Apply for Respite Care</a>
            <h3>Finally, Get Ready To Party!</h3>
            <p>Once a spot opens up, we will schedule an intake interview. We will review any behavioral and medical needs regarding your child. Either the nurse or our behavioral center manager will develop a plan to handle your child’s needs in a positive, loving way. After a few visits, many of our Respite kids tell their parents that they wait all month for Respite because they have so much fun!</p>
